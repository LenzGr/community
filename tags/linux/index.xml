Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Amazon EKS is certified Kubernetes-conformant, so existing applications that run on upstream Kubernetes are compatible with Amazon EKS.
Getting started guides available in the AWS documentation explain two different procedures for creating an EKS cluster.</description></item><item><title>Setting up PMM for monitoring MySQL on a local environment</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/08/05/setting-up-pmm-for-monitoring-mysql-on-a-local-environment/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/08/05/setting-up-pmm-for-monitoring-mysql-on-a-local-environment/</guid><description>Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, observability, and management tool that can be used for monitoring the health of your database infrastructure, exploring new patterns in database behavior, and managing and improving the performance of your databases no matter where they are located or deployed.
PMM is designed to work with MySQL (including Percona Server for MySQL, Percona XtraDB Cluster, Oracle MySQL Community Edition, Oracle MySQL Enterprise Edition, and MariaDB), PostgreSQL (including Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL), MongoDB (including Percona Server for MongoDB), Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Proxy SQL, and Percona XtraDB Cluster.</description></item><item><title>Embracing the Stream</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/12/10/embracing-the-stream/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 10:33:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/12/10/embracing-the-stream/</guid><description>So this happened: CentOS Project shifts focus to CentOS Stream
The future of the CentOS Project is CentOS Stream, and over the next year we’ll be shifting focus from CentOS Linux, the rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), to CentOS Stream, which tracks just ahead of a current RHEL release. CentOS Linux 8, as a rebuild of RHEL 8, will end at the end of 2021. CentOS Stream continues after that date, serving as the upstream (development) branch of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</description></item></channel></rss>
