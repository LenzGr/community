I often get requests from novices starting with MySQL or intermediates looking to level up on recommendations on books targeted at their level. The MySQL Workshop (Amazon link) by Thomas Pettit and Scott Cosentino is a must buy for those two groups, or those of us who would like a handy reference.
This is a great book and I recommend getting a copy regardless of your MySQL expertise.</description></item></channel></rss>
